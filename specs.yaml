        Payment creation is elemental to the Mollie API: this is where most payment
        implementations start off.

        Once you have created a payment, you should redirect your customer to the
        URL in the `_links.checkout` property from the response.

        To wrap your head around the payment process, an explanation and flow charts
        can be found in the 'Accepting payments' guide.

        If you specify the `method` parameter when creating a payment, optional
        additional parameters may be available for the payment method that are not listed below. Please refer to the
        guide on [method-specific parameters](extra-payment-parameters).
      parameters:
        - description: This endpoint allows you to include additional information via the `include` query string parameter.
          schema:

                    The identifier uniquely referring to this payment. Mollie assigns this identifier at payment creation time. Mollie
                    will always refer to the payment by this ID. Example: `tr_5B8cwPMGnU6qLbRvo7qEZo`.

                  type: string

                  description: |-
                    The description of the payment. This will be shown to your customer on their card or bank statement when possible.
                    We truncate the description automatically according to the limits of the used payment method. The description is
                    also visible in any exports you generate.

                    We recommend you use a unique identifier so that you can always link the payment to the order in your back office.
                    This is particularly useful for bookkeeping.

                    The maximum length of the description field differs per payment method, with the absolute maximum being 255
                    characters. The API will not reject strings longer than the maximum length but it will truncate them to fit.
                  maxLength: 255
                  example: Chess Board
                amount:
                  description: |-
                    The amount that you want to charge, e.g. `{currency:"EUR", value:"1000.00"}` if you would want to charge €1000.00.

                    You can find the minimum and maximum amounts per payment method in our help center. Additionally, they can be
                    retrieved using the Get method endpoint.

                    If a tip was added for a Point-of-Sale payment, the amount will be updated to reflect the initial amount plus the
                    tip amount.

                    payment methods, this amount may be higher than the payment amount, for example to allow reimbursement of the

                    The total amount that was charged back for this payment. Only available when the total charged back amount is not
                    zero.

                settlementAmount:
                  description: |-
                    This optional field will contain the approximate amount that will be settled to your account, converted to the
                    currency your account is settled in.

                    Any amounts not settled by Mollie will not be reflected in this amount, e.g. PayPal or gift cards. If no amount is
                    settled by Mollie the `settlementAmount` is omitted from the response.

                    Please note that this amount might be recalculated and changed when the status of the payment changes. We suggest
                    using the List balance transactions endpoint instead to get more accurate settlement amounts for your payments.
                  readOnly: true
                  type: object
                  required: *ref_0
                  properties: *ref_1
                redirectUrl:
                  type:
                    - string
                    - 'null'
                  description: |-
                    The URL your customer will be redirected to after the payment process.

                    It could make sense for the redirectUrl to contain a unique identifier – like your order ID – so you can show the
                    right page referencing the order when your customer returns.

                    The parameter is normally required, but can be omitted for recurring payments (`sequenceType: recurring`) and for
                    Apple Pay payments with an `applePayPaymentToken`.
                  example: https://example.org/redirect
                cancelUrl:
                  type:
                    - string
                    - 'null'
                  description: |-
                    The URL your customer will be redirected to when the customer explicitly cancels the payment. If this URL is not
                    provided, the customer will be redirected to the `redirectUrl` instead — see above.

                    Mollie will always give you status updates via webhooks, including for the canceled status. This parameter is
                    therefore entirely optional, but can be useful when implementing a dedicated customer-facing flow to handle
                    payment cancellations.
                  example: https://example.org/cancel
                webhookUrl:
                  type:
                    - string
                    - 'null'
                  description: |-
                    The webhook URL where we will send payment status updates to.

                    The webhookUrl is optional, but without a webhook you will miss out on important status changes to your payment.

                    The webhookUrl must be reachable from Mollie's point of view, so you cannot use `localhost`. If you want to use
                    webhook during development on `localhost`, you must use a tool like ngrok to have the webhooks delivered to your
                    local machine.
                  example: https://example.org/webhooks
                lines:
                  type:
                    - array
                    - 'null'
                  description: |-
                    Optionally provide the order lines for the payment. Each line contains details such as a description of the item
                    ordered and its price.

                    All lines must have the same currency as the payment.

                    Required for payment methods `billie`, `in3`, `klarna`, `riverty` and `voucher`.
                  items:

                              For example: `{"currency":"EUR", "value":"89.00"}` if the box of LEGO costs €89.00 each.

                              For types `discount`, `store_credit`, and `gift_card`, the unit price must be negative.

                              The unit price can be zero in case of free items.

                              Should match the following formula: `(unitPrice × quantity) - discountAmount`.

                              The sum of all `totalAmount` values of all order lines should be equal to the full payment amount.

                              not as a float, to ensure the correct number of decimals are passed.
                            example: '21.00'

                              The amount of value-added tax on the line. The `totalAmount` field includes VAT, so the `vatAmount` can be
                              calculated with the formula `totalAmount × (vatRate / (100 + vatRate))`.

                              Any deviations from this will result in an error.

                              For example, for a `totalAmount` of SEK 100.00 with a 25.00% VAT rate, we expect a VAT amount of
                              `SEK 100.00 × (25 / 125) = SEK 20.00`.

                    For bank transfer payments specifically, the locale will determine the target bank account the customer has to

                    Some payment methods are a network of connected banks or card issuers. In these cases, after selecting the payment
                    method, the customer may still need to select the appropriate issuer before the payment can proceed.

                    We provide hosted issuer selection screens, but these screens can be skipped by providing the `issuer` via the API
                    up front.

                    The full list of issuers for a specific method can be retrieved via the Methods API by using the optional
                    `issuers` include.

                    A valid issuer for iDEAL is for example `ideal_INGBNL2A` (for ING Bank).

                    By default, we charge the customer's card or bank account immediately when they complete the payment. If you set a

                    With Mollie Connect you can charge fees on payments that your app is processing on behalf of other Mollie
                    merchants.

                    If you use OAuth to create payments on a connected merchant's account, you can charge a fee using this
                    `applicationFee` parameter. If the payment succeeds, the fee will be deducted from the merchant's balance and sent
                    to your own account balance.

                    If instead you want to split a payment on your own account between yourself and a connected merchant, refer to the
                    `routing` parameter.

                        Be careful to leave enough space for Mollie's own fees to be deducted as well. For example, you cannot charge
                        a €0.99 fee on a €1.00 payment.

                    If you create payments on your own account that you want to split between yourself and one or more connected
                    merchants, you can use this `routing` parameter to route the payment accordingly.

                    The `routing` parameter should contain an array of objects, with each object describing the destination for a
                    specific portion of the payment.

                    It is not necessary to indicate in the array which portion goes to yourself. After all portions of the total
                    payment amount have been routed, the amount left will be routed to the current organization automatically.

                    Indicate which part of a recurring sequence this payment is for.

                    Recurring payments can only take place if a mandate is available. A common way to establish such a mandate is
                    through a `first` payment. With a `first` payment, the customer agrees to automatic recurring charges taking place
                    on their account in the future.

                    If set to `recurring`, the customer's card is charged automatically.

                    Defaults to `oneoff`, which is a regular non-recurring payment.

                    For PayPal payments, recurring is only possible if your connected PayPal account allows it. You can call our
                    [Methods API](list-methods) with parameter `sequenceType: first` to discover which payment methods on your account
                    are set up correctly for recurring payments.

                    When creating recurring payments, the ID of a specific [mandate](get-mandate) can be supplied to indicate which of

                    If `sequenceType` is set to `recurring`, this field is required.

                          We truncate the description automatically according to the limits of the used payment method. The description is
                          also visible in any exports you generate.

                          We recommend you use a unique identifier so that you can always link the payment to the order in your back office.
                          This is particularly useful for bookkeeping.

                          The maximum length of the description field differs per payment method, with the absolute maximum being 255
                          characters. The API will not reject strings longer than the maximum length but it will truncate them to fit.

                          This optional field will contain the approximate amount that will be settled to your account, converted to the
                          currency your account is settled in.

                          Any amounts not settled by Mollie will not be reflected in this amount, e.g. PayPal or gift cards. If no amount is
                          settled by Mollie the `settlementAmount` is omitted from the response.

                          Please note that this amount might be recalculated and changed when the status of the payment changes. We suggest
                          using the List balance transactions endpoint instead to get more accurate settlement amounts for your payments.

                          The URL your customer will be redirected to after the payment process.

                          It could make sense for the redirectUrl to contain a unique identifier – like your order ID – so you can show the
                          right page referencing the order when your customer returns.

                          The parameter is normally required, but can be omitted for recurring payments (`sequenceType: recurring`) and for
                          Apple Pay payments with an `applePayPaymentToken`.
                        example: https://example.org/redirect
                      cancelUrl:
                        type:
                          - string

                          The URL your customer will be redirected to when the customer explicitly cancels the payment. If this URL is not
                          provided, the customer will be redirected to the `redirectUrl` instead — see above.

                          Mollie will always give you status updates via webhooks, including for the canceled status. This parameter is
                          therefore entirely optional, but can be useful when implementing a dedicated customer-facing flow to handle
                          payment cancellations.
                        example: https://example.org/cancel
                      webhookUrl:
                        type:
                          - string
                          - 'null'
                        description: |-
                          The webhook URL where we will send payment status updates to.

                          The webhookUrl is optional, but without a webhook you will miss out on important status changes to your payment.

                          The webhookUrl must be reachable from Mollie's point of view, so you cannot use `localhost`. If you want to use
                          webhook during development on `localhost`, you must use a tool like ngrok to have the webhooks delivered to your
                          local machine.
                        example: https://example.org/webhooks

                          All lines must have the same currency as the payment.

                          is highly recommended and will greatly improve your conversion rate. When this parameter is omitted the browser
                          language will be used instead if supported by the payment method. You can provide any `xx_XX` format ISO 15897
                          locale, but our hosted payment pages currently only support the specified languages.

                          For bank transfer payments specifically, the locale will determine the target bank account the customer has to
                          transfer the money to. We have dedicated bank accounts for Belgium, Germany, and The Netherlands. Having the
                          customer use a local bank account greatly increases the conversion and speed of payment.

                          Normally, a payment method screen is shown. However, when using this parameter, you can choose a specific payment
                          method and your customer will skip the selection screen and is sent directly to the chosen payment method. The
                          parameter enables you to fully integrate the payment method selection into your website.

                          You can also specify the methods in an array. By doing so we will still show the payment method selection screen
                          but will only show the methods specified in the array. For example, you can use this functionality to only show

                          Some payment methods are a network of connected banks or card issuers. In these cases, after selecting the payment
                          method, the customer may still need to select the appropriate issuer before the payment can proceed.

                          We provide hosted issuer selection screens, but these screens can be skipped by providing the `issuer` via the API
                          up front.

                          The full list of issuers for a specific method can be retrieved via the Methods API by using the optional
                          `issuers` include.

                          A valid issuer for iDEAL is for example `ideal_INGBNL2A` (for ING Bank).

                          Some payment methods allow placing a hold on the card or bank account. This hold or 'authorization' can then at a
                          later point either be 'captured' or canceled.

                          By default, we charge the customer's card or bank account immediately when they complete the payment. If you set a
                          capture delay however, we will delay the automatic capturing of the payment for the specified amount of time. For
                          example `8 hours` or `2 days`.

                          To schedule an automatic capture, the `captureMode` must be set to `automatic`.

                          The maximum delay is 7 days (168 hours).

                          With Mollie Connect you can charge fees on payments that your app is processing on behalf of other Mollie
                          merchants.

                          If you use OAuth to create payments on a connected merchant's account, you can charge a fee using this
                          `applicationFee` parameter. If the payment succeeds, the fee will be deducted from the merchant's balance and sent
                          to your own account balance.

                          If instead you want to split a payment on your own account between yourself and a connected merchant, refer to the
                          `routing` parameter.

                              Be careful to leave enough space for Mollie's own fees to be deducted as well. For example, you cannot charge
                              a €0.99 fee on a €1.00 payment.

                          With Mollie Connect you can charge fees on payments that your app is processing on behalf of other Mollie
                          merchants.

                          If you create payments on your own account that you want to split between yourself and one or more connected
                          merchants, you can use this `routing` parameter to route the payment accordingly.

                          The `routing` parameter should contain an array of objects, with each object describing the destination for a
                          specific portion of the payment.

                          It is not necessary to indicate in the array which portion goes to yourself. After all portions of the total
                          payment amount have been routed, the amount left will be routed to the current organization automatically.

                          If instead you use OAuth to create payments on a connected merchant's account, refer to the `applicationFee`
                          parameter.

                          Indicate which part of a recurring sequence this payment is for.

                          Recurring payments can only take place if a mandate is available. A common way to establish such a mandate is
                          through a `first` payment. With a `first` payment, the customer agrees to automatic recurring charges taking place
                          on their account in the future.

                          If set to `recurring`, the customer's card is charged automatically.

                          Defaults to `oneoff`, which is a regular non-recurring payment.

                          For PayPal payments, recurring is only possible if your connected PayPal account allows it. You can call our
                          [Methods API](list-methods) with parameter `sequenceType: first` to discover which payment methods on your account
                          are set up correctly for recurring payments.

                          When creating recurring payments, the ID of a specific [mandate](get-mandate) can be supplied to indicate which of
                          the customer's accounts should be credited.

                          The ID of the [customer](get-customer) the payment is being created for. This is used primarily for recurring
                          payments, but can also be used on regular payments to enable single-click payments.

                          If `sequenceType` is set to `recurring`, this field is required.
                        example: cst_5B8cwPMGnU

                          When using an API Key, the `profileId` can be omitted since it is linked to the key. However, for OAuth and
                          Organization tokens, the `profileId` is required.

                              For test mode payments in certain scenarios, a hosted interface is available to help you test different
                              payment states.

                              Firstly, for recurring test mode payments. Recurring payments do not have a checkout URL, because these
                              payments are executed without any user interaction.

                              Secondly, for paid test mode payments. The payment state screen will then allow you to create a refund or
                              chargeback for the test payment.

                    The description of the payment. This will be shown to your customer on their card or bank statement when possible.
                    We truncate the description automatically according to the limits of the used payment method. The description is
                    also visible in any exports you generate.

                    We recommend you use a unique identifier so that you can always link the payment to the order in your back office.
                    This is particularly useful for bookkeeping.

                    The maximum length of the description field differs per payment method, with the absolute maximum being 255
                    characters. The API will not reject strings longer than the maximum length but it will truncate them to fit.
                  maxLength: 255
                  example: Chess Board
                redirectUrl:
                  type: &ref_110
                    - string
                    - 'null'
                  description: |-
                    The URL your customer will be redirected to after the payment process.

                    It could make sense for the redirectUrl to contain a unique identifier – like your order ID – so you can show the
                    right page referencing the order when your customer returns.

                    The parameter is normally required, but can be omitted for recurring payments (`sequenceType: recurring`) and for
                    Apple Pay payments with an `applePayPaymentToken`.
                  example: https://example.org/redirect
                cancelUrl:
                  type: &ref_111
                    - string
                    - 'null'
                  description: |-
                    The URL your customer will be redirected to when the customer explicitly cancels the payment. If this URL is not
                    provided, the customer will be redirected to the `redirectUrl` instead — see above.

                    Mollie will always give you status updates via webhooks, including for the canceled status. This parameter is
                    therefore entirely optional, but can be useful when implementing a dedicated customer-facing flow to handle
                    payment cancellations.
                  example: https://example.org/cancel
                webhookUrl:
                  type: &ref_112
                    - string
                    - 'null'
                  description: |-
                    The webhook URL where we will send payment status updates to.

                    The webhookUrl is optional, but without a webhook you will miss out on important status changes to your payment.

                    The webhookUrl must be reachable from Mollie's point of view, so you cannot use `localhost`. If you want to use
                    webhook during development on `localhost`, you must use a tool like ngrok to have the webhooks delivered to your
                    local machine.

                    Provide any data you like, for example a string or a JSON object. We will save the data alongside the entity. Whenever
                    you fetch the entity with our API, we will also include the metadata. You can use up to approximately 1kB.
                method:
                  type: *ref_11
                  description: |-
                    Normally, a payment method screen is shown. However, when using this parameter, you can choose a specific payment
                    method and your customer will skip the selection screen and is sent directly to the chosen payment method. The
                    parameter enables you to fully integrate the payment method selection into your website.

                    You can also specify the methods in an array. By doing so we will still show the payment method selection screen
                    but will only show the methods specified in the array. For example, you can use this functionality to only show
                    payment methods from a specific country to your customer `['bancontact', 'belfius']`.

                    For digital goods in most jurisdictions, you must apply the VAT rate from your customer's country. Choose the VAT

                    Use this parameter to restrict the payment methods available to your customer to those from a single country.

                    **⚠️ With the introduction of iDEAL 2 in 2025, this field will be ignored for iDEAL payments. For more information
                    on the migration, refer to our [help center](https://help.mollie.com/hc/articles/19100313768338-iDEAL-2-0).**

                    Some payment methods are a network of connected banks or card issuers. In these cases, after selecting the payment
                    method, the customer may still need to select the appropriate issuer before the payment can proceed.

                    We provide hosted issuer selection screens, but these screens can be skipped by providing the `issuer` via the API
                    up front.

                    The full list of issuers for a specific method can be retrieved via the Methods API by using the optional
                    `issuers` include.

                    A valid issuer for iDEAL is for example `ideal_INGBNL2A` (for ING Bank).

                    omitted. For organization-level credentials such as OAuth access tokens, you can enable test mode by setting
                    `testmode` to `true`.

        Retrieve all enabled payment methods. The results of this endpoint are
        **not** paginated — unlike most other list endpoints in our API.

        For test mode, all pending and enabled payment methods are returned. If no
        payment methods are requested yet, the most popular payment methods are returned in the test mode. For live
        mode, only fully enabled payment methods are returned.

        Payment methods can be requested and enabled via the Mollie Dashboard, or
        via the [Enable payment method endpoint](enable-method) of the Profiles API.

        The list can optionally be filtered using a number of parameters described
        below.

        By default, only payment methods for the Euro currency are returned. If you
        wish to retrieve payment methods which exclusively support other currencies (e.g. Twint), you need to use the
        `amount` parameters.

            Set this parameter to `first` to only return the enabled methods that
            can be used for the first payment of a recurring sequence.

            retrieve the resources for.

            Most API credentials are linked to a single profile. In these cases the `profileId` can be omitted. For
            organization-level credentials such as OAuth access tokens however, the `profileId` parameter is required.

            Most API credentials are specifically created for either live mode or test mode. In those cases the `testmode` query
            parameter can be omitted. For organization-level credentials such as OAuth access tokens, you can enable test mode by
            setting the `testmode` query parameter to `true`.

            Test entities cannot be retrieved when the endpoint is set to live mode, and vice versa.

        Retrieve a single payment method by its ID.

        If a method is not available on this profile, a `404 Not Found` response is
        returned. If the method is available but not enabled yet, a status `403 Forbidden` is returned. You can enable
        payments methods via the [Enable payment method endpoint](enable-method) of the Profiles API, or via
        the Mollie Dashboard.

        If you do not know the method's ID, you can use the [methods list
        endpoint](list-methods) to retrieve all payment methods that are available.

        Additionally, it is possible to check if wallet methods such as Apple Pay
        are enabled by passing the wallet ID (`applepay`) as the method ID.

        Some payment methods require extra steps in order to be activated. In cases

                    When enabling a voucher issuer, an inbetween party may be involved which you have a contract with.
                    Provide the contract ID for the first time you enable an issuer via this contractor.

                    You can update the contract ID as long as it is not approved yet, by repeating the API call with a
                    different contract ID.

                    To retrieve accurate settlement amounts we recommend using the

                    With Mollie Connect you can charge fees on payments that your app is processing on behalf of other Mollie
                    merchants, by providing the `routing` object during [payment creation](create-payment).

                    When creating refunds for these *routed* payments, by default the full amount is deducted from your balance.

                    If you want to pull back the funds that were routed to the connected merchant(s), you can set this parameter to
                    `true` when issuing a full refund.

                    For more fine-grained control and for partial refunds, use the `routingReversals` parameter instead.

                      This optional field will contain the approximate amount that will be deducted from your account balance, converted
                      to the currency your account is settled in.

                      The amount is a **negative** amount.

                      If the refund is not directly processed by Mollie, for example for PayPal refunds, the settlement amount will be
                      zero.

                      Since the field contains an estimated amount during refund processing, it may change over time. For example, while
                      the refund is queued the settlement amount is likely not yet available.

                      To retrieve accurate settlement amounts we recommend using the
                      [List balance transactions endpoint](list-balance-transactions) instead.

                      With Mollie Connect you can charge fees on payments that your app is processing on behalf of other Mollie
                      merchants, by providing the `routing` object during [payment creation](create-payment).

                      When creating refunds for these *routed* payments, by default the full amount is deducted from your balance.

                      If you want to pull back the funds that were routed to the connected merchant(s), you can set this parameter to
                      `true` when issuing a full refund.

                      For more fine-grained control and for partial refunds, use the `routingReversals` parameter instead.

                      If you simply want to fully reverse the routed funds, you can also use the `reverseRouting` parameter instead.

        Capture an *authorized* payment.

        Some payment methods allow you to first collect a customer's authorization,
        and capture the amount at a later point.

        By default, Mollie captures payments automatically. If however you
        configured your payment with `captureMode: manual`, you can capture the payment using this endpoint after
        having collected the customer's authorization.

            Most API credentials are specifically created for either live mode or test mode. In those cases the `testmode` query
            parameter can be omitted. For organization-level credentials such as OAuth access tokens, you can enable test mode by
            setting the `testmode` query parameter to `true`.

            Test entities cannot be retrieved when the endpoint is set to live mode, and vice versa.

        When integrating Apple Pay in your own checkout on the web, you need to
        [provide merchant validation](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/apple_pay_on_the_web/apple_pay_js_api/providing_merchant_validation).
        This is normally done using Apple's
        [Requesting an Apple Pay Session](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/apple_pay_on_the_web/apple_pay_js_api/requesting_an_apple_pay_payment_session).
        The merchant validation proves to Apple that a validated merchant is calling the Apple Pay Javascript APIs.

        To integrate Apple Pay via Mollie, you will have to call the Mollie API instead of Apple's API. The response of this
        API call can then be passed as-is to the completion method, `completeMerchantValidation`.

        Before requesting an Apple Pay Payment Session, you must place the domain validation file on your server at:
        `https://[domain]/.well-known/apple-developer-merchantid-domain-association`. Without this file, it will not be
        possible to use Apple Pay on your domain.

        Each new transaction requires a new payment session object. Merchant session objects are not reusable, and they
        expire after five minutes.

        Payment sessions cannot be requested directly from the browser. The request must be sent from your server. For the
        full documentation, see the official
        [Apple Pay JS API](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/apple_pay_on_the_web/apple_pay_js_api) documentation.

                    `validationUrl`s that have a host name not in the list.

                    `profileId` parameter is required.

        The payment link can be shared with your customers and will redirect them to them the payment page where they can
        complete the payment. A [payment](get-payment) will only be created once the customer initiates the payment.

                      With Mollie Connect you can charge fees on payment links that your app is processing on behalf of other Mollie
                      merchants.

                      If you use OAuth to create payment links on a connected merchant's account, you can charge a fee using this
                      `applicationFee` parameter. If a payment on the payment link succeeds, the fee will be deducted from the merchant's balance and sent
                      to your own account balance.

                          Be careful to leave enough space for Mollie's own fees to be deducted as well. For example, you cannot charge
                          a €0.99 fee on a €1.00 payment.

            Most API credentials are specifically created for either live mode or test mode. In those cases the `testmode` query
            parameter can be omitted. For organization-level credentials such as OAuth access tokens, you can enable test mode by
            setting the `testmode` query parameter to `true`.

            Test entities cannot be retrieved when the endpoint is set to live mode, and vice versa.

        Payment links which have not been opened and no payments have been made yet can be deleted entirely.
        This can be useful for removing payment links that have been incorrectly configured or that are no longer relevant.

        Once deleted, the payment link will no longer show up in the API or Mollie dashboard.

        To simply disable a payment link without fully deleting it, you can use the `archived` parameter on the
        [Update payment link](update-payment-link) endpoint instead.

                                Most API credentials are linked to a single profile. In these cases the `profileId` can be omitted in the creation
                                request. For organization-level credentials such as OAuth access tokens however, the `profileId` parameter is
                                required.

        Creates a payment for the customer.

        Linking customers to payments enables you to:

        * Keep track of payment preferences for your customers
        * Allow your customers to charge a previously used credit card with a single click in our hosted checkout
        * Improve payment insights in the Mollie dashboard
        * Use recurring payments

        This endpoint is effectively an alias of the [Create payment endpoint](create-payment) with the `customerId`
        parameter predefined.

            The identifier referring to the [profile](get-profile) you wish to
            retrieve the resources for.

            Most API credentials are linked to a single profile. In these cases the `profileId` can be omitted. For
            organization-level credentials such as OAuth access tokens however, the `profileId` parameter is required.

            Most API credentials are specifically created for either live mode or test mode. In those cases the `testmode` query
            parameter can be omitted. For organization-level credentials such as OAuth access tokens, you can enable test mode by
            setting the `testmode` query parameter to `true`.

            Test entities cannot be retrieved when the endpoint is set to live mode, and vice versa.

        Create a mandate for a specific customer. Mandates allow you to charge a customer's card, PayPal account or bank
        account recurrently.

        It is only possible to create mandates for IBANs and PayPal billing agreements with this endpoint. To create
        mandates for cards, your customers need to perform a 'first payment' with their card.

        With subscriptions, you can schedule recurring payments to take place at regular intervals.

        For example, by simply specifying an `amount` and an `interval`, you can create an endless subscription to charge a
        monthly fee, until you cancel the subscription.

        Or, you could use the times parameter to only charge a limited number of times, for example to split a big
        transaction in multiple parts.

        A few example usages:

        `amount[currency]="EUR"` `amount[value]="5.00"` `interval="2 weeks"`
        Your customer will be charged €5 once every two weeks.

        `amount[currency]="EUR"` `amount[value]="20.00"` `interval="1 day" times=5`
        Your customer will be charged €20 every day, for five consecutive days.

        `amount[currency]="EUR"` `amount[value]="10.00"` `interval="1 month"`
        `startDate="2018-04-30"`
        Your customer will be charged €10 on the last day of each month, starting in April 2018.

                    The subscription's description will be used as the description of the resulting individual payments and so showing
                    up on the bank statement of the consumer.

                    **Please note:** the description needs to be unique for the Customer in case it has multiple active subscriptions.

                    Interval to wait between payments, for example `1 month` or `14 days`.

                    The maximum interval is one year (`12 months`, `52 weeks`, or `365 days`).
                  enum:
                    - ... days
                    - ... weeks
                    - ... months

                    Total number of payments for the subscription. Once this number of payments is reached, the subscription is
                    considered completed.

                    Test mode subscriptions will get canceled automatically after 10 payments.
                  example: 6

                    Provide any data you like, for example a string or a JSON object. We will save the data alongside the
                    entity. Whenever you fetch the entity with our API, we will also include the metadata. You can use up to
                    approximately 1kB.

                    Any metadata added to the subscription will be automatically forwarded to the payments generated for it.

                    We will call this URL for any payment status changes of payments resulting from this subscription.

                    This webhook will receive **all** events for the subscription's payments. This may include payment
                    failures as well. Be sure to verify the payment's subscription ID and its status.

                    Most API credentials are specifically created for either live mode or test mode. For organization-level credentials
                    such as OAuth access tokens, you can enable test mode by setting `testmode` to `true`.

            Most API credentials are specifically created for either live mode or test mode. In those cases the `testmode` query
            parameter can be omitted. For organization-level credentials such as OAuth access tokens, you can enable test mode by
            setting the `testmode` query parameter to `true`.

            Test entities cannot be retrieved when the endpoint is set to live mode, and vice versa.

        Retrieve a single organization by its ID.

        You can normally only retrieve the currently authenticated organization with this endpoint. This is primarily useful
        for OAuth apps. See also [Get current organization](get-current-organization).

        If you have a *partner account*', you can retrieve organization details of connected organizations.

            Most API credentials are specifically created for either live mode or test mode. In those cases the `testmode` query
            parameter can be omitted. For organization-level credentials such as OAuth access tokens, you can enable test mode by
            setting the `testmode` query parameter to `true`.

            Test entities cannot be retrieved when the endpoint is set to live mode, and vice versa.

        Retrieve a list of capabilities for an organization.

        This API provides detailed insights into the specific requirements and status of each client's onboarding journey.

        Capabilities are at the organization level, indicating if the organization can perform a given capability.

        For payments, regardless them being at the profile level, the capability is listed at the organization level.
        This means that if at least one of the clients's profiles can receive payments,
        the payments capability is enabled, communicating that the organization can indeed receive payments.

      description: |-
        Link a new or existing organization to your OAuth application, in effect creating a new client. The response
        contains a `clientLink` where you should redirect your customer to.

        ## Redirecting the Customer

        The `clientLink` URL behaves similarly to a standard OAuth authorization URL. Therefore, after receiving the
        `clientLink` URL in the API response, you need to **append the following query parameters** *before* redirecting
        the customer:

        * `client_id` _string (required)_

          The client ID you received when you registered your OAuth app. The ID starts with `app_`. For example:
          `app_abc123qwerty`.

        * `state` _string (required)_

          A random string **generated by your app** to prevent CSRF attacks. This will be reflected in the `state` query
          parameter when the user returns to the `redirect_uri` after authorizing your app.

        * `scope` _string (required)_

          A space-separated list of permissions ('scopes') your app requires. See the
          [permissions list](https://docs.mollie.com/docs/connect-permissions) for more information about the available
          scopes.

          We recommend at least : `onboarding.read onboarding.write`

        * `approval_prompt` _string_

          Can be set to `force` to force showing the consent screen to the merchant, *even when it is not necessary*. If you
          force an approval prompt and the user creates a new authorization, previously active authorizations will be
          revoked.

          Possible values: `auto` `force` (default: `auto`)

        ### Example of a Complete Redirect URL

        After adding the above url parameter your URL will look something like this and you can redirect your client to this
        page:

        ```
        https://my.mollie.com/dashboard/client-link/{id}?client_id={your_client_id}&state={unique_state}&scope=onboarding.read%20onboarding.write
        ```

        ## Error Handling

        Error handling is also dealt with similar to the [Authorize](https://docs.mollie.com/reference/authorize) endpoint:
        the customer is redirected back to your app's redirect URL with the `error` and `error_description` parameters added
        to the URL.

        > 🚧
        >
        > A client link must be used within 30 days of creation. After that period, it will expire and you will need to create a new client link.

      description: |-
        When processing payments with Mollie, we put all pending funds — usually
        minus Mollie fees — on a balance. Once you have linked a bank account to your Mollie account, we can pay out your
        balance towards this bank account.

        With the Balances API you can retrieve your current balance. The response
        includes two amounts:

        * The *pending amount*. These are payments that have been marked as `paid`,
        but are not yet available on your balance.
        * The *available amount*. This is the amount that you can get paid out to
        your bank account, or use for refunds.

        With instant payment methods like iDEAL, payments are moved to the available
        balance instantly. With slower payment methods, like credit card for example, it can take a few days before the
        funds are available on your balance. These funds will be shown under the *pending amount* in the meanwhile.
      parameters:
        - name: testmode
          description: |-
            Most API credentials are specifically created for either live mode or test mode. In those cases the `testmode` query
            parameter can be omitted. For organization-level credentials such as OAuth access tokens, you can enable test mode by
            setting the `testmode` query parameter to `true`.

            Test entities cannot be retrieved when the endpoint is set to live mode, and vice versa.

            available (e.g. payment method).

            With the `transaction-categories` format, transactions are grouped by
            transaction type, then by status, and then again by other sub-groupings where available.

                      You can retrieve reports in two different formats. With the `status-balances` format, transactions are grouped by
                      status (e.g. `pending`, `available`), then by direction of movement (e.g. moved from pending to available), then
                      by transaction type, and then by other sub-groupings where available (e.g. payment method).

                      Both reporting formats will always contain opening and closing amounts that correspond to the start and end dates

                      Totals are grouped according to the chosen grouping rule. The example response should give a good idea of what a
                      typical grouping looks like.

                      If grouping `status-balances` is chosen, the main grouping is as follows:

                      * `pendingBalance` containing an `open`, `pending`, `movedToAvailable`, and `close` sub-group
                      * `availableBalance` containing an `open`, `movedFromPending`, `immediatelyAvailable`, and `close` sub-group

                      If grouping `transaction-categories` is chosen, the main grouping is as follows:

                      * `open` and `close` groups, each containing a `pending` and `available` sub-group
                      * Transaction type groups such as `payments`, `refunds`, `chargebacks`, `capital`, `transfers`, `fee-prepayments`, `corrections`, `topups`
                      each containing a `pending`, `movedToAvailable`, and
                      `immediatelyAvailable` sub-group

                      Each sub-group typically has:

                      * An `amount` object containing the group's total amount

            Most API credentials are specifically created for either live mode or test mode. In those cases the `testmode` query
            parameter can be omitted. For organization-level credentials such as OAuth access tokens, you can enable test mode by

                                For bookkeeping purposes, the settlement includes an overview of transactions included in the settlement. These
                                transactions are grouped into 'period' objects — one for each calendar month.

                                For example, if a settlement includes funds from 15 April until 4 May, it will include two period objects. One for
                                all transactions processed between 15 April and 30 April, and one for all transactions between 1 May and 4 May.

                                Period objects are grouped by year, and then by month. So in the above example, the full `periods` collection will
                                look as follows: `{"2024": {"04": {...}, "05": {...}}}`. The year and month in this documentation are referred as `<year>` and `<month>`.

                                The example response should give a good idea of what this looks like in practise.

        Retrieve a single settlement by its ID.

        To lookup settlements by their bank reference, replace the ID in the URL by
        a reference. For example: `1234567.2404.03`.

        A settlement represents a transfer of your balance funds to your external bank account.

        Settlements will typically include a report that details what balance transactions have taken place between this
        settlement and the previous one.

        For more accurate bookkeeping, refer to the [balance report](get-balance-report) endpoint or the
        [balance transactions](list-balance-transactions) endpoint.

            Most API credentials are specifically created for either live mode or test mode. In those cases the `testmode` query
            parameter can be omitted. For organization-level credentials such as OAuth access tokens, you can enable test mode by
            setting the `testmode` query parameter to `true`.

            Test entities cannot be retrieved when the endpoint is set to live mode, and vice versa.

                    A `draft` invoice is not paid or not sent and can be updated after creation. Setting it to `issued` sends it to
                    the recipient so they may then pay through our payment system. To skip our payment process, set this to `paid` to
                    mark it as paid. It can then subsequently be sent as well, same as with `issued`.

                    A status value that cannot be set but can be returned is `canceled`, for invoices which were
                    issued, but then canceled. Currently this can only be done for invoices created in the dashboard.

        Normally, a payment method screen is shown. However, when using this parameter, you can choose a specific payment
        method and your customer will skip the selection screen and is sent directly to the chosen payment method. The
        parameter enables you to fully integrate the payment method selection into your website.

        You can also specify the methods in an array. By doing so we will still show the payment method selection screen
        but will only show the methods specified in the array. For example, you can use this functionality to only show
        payment methods from a specific country to your customer `['bancontact', 'belfius']`.

    description:
      type: string
      description: |-
        The description of the payment. This will be shown to your customer on their card or bank statement when possible.
        We truncate the description automatically according to the limits of the used payment method. The description is
        also visible in any exports you generate.

        We recommend you use a unique identifier so that you can always link the payment to the order in your back office.
        This is particularly useful for bookkeeping.

        The maximum length of the description field differs per payment method, with the absolute maximum being 255
        characters. The API will not reject strings longer than the maximum length but it will truncate them to fit.
      maxLength: 255
      example: Chess Board
    redirectUrl:
      type: *ref_110
      description: |-
        The URL your customer will be redirected to after the payment process.

        It could make sense for the redirectUrl to contain a unique identifier – like your order ID – so you can show the
        right page referencing the order when your customer returns.

        The parameter is normally required, but can be omitted for recurring payments (`sequenceType: recurring`) and for
        Apple Pay payments with an `applePayPaymentToken`.
      example: https://example.org/redirect
    cancelUrl:
      type: *ref_111
      description: |-
        The URL your customer will be redirected to when the customer explicitly cancels the payment. If this URL is not
        provided, the customer will be redirected to the `redirectUrl` instead — see above.

        Mollie will always give you status updates via webhooks, including for the canceled status. This parameter is
        therefore entirely optional, but can be useful when implementing a dedicated customer-facing flow to handle
        payment cancellations.
      example: https://example.org/cancel
    webhookUrl:
      type: *ref_112
      description: |-
        The webhook URL where we will send payment status updates to.

        The webhookUrl is optional, but without a webhook you will miss out on important status changes to your payment.

        The webhookUrl must be reachable from Mollie's point of view, so you cannot use `localhost`. If you want to use
        webhook during development on `localhost`, you must use a tool like ngrok to have the webhooks delivered to your
        local machine.
      example: https://example.org/webhooks
    dueDate:

      writeOnly: true
    restrictPaymentMethodsToCountry:
      type: *ref_113
      description: |-
        For digital goods in most jurisdictions, you must apply the VAT rate from your customer's country. Choose the VAT
        rates you have used for the order to ensure your customer's country matches the VAT country.

        Use this parameter to restrict the payment methods available to your customer to those from a single country.

        If available, the credit card method will still be offered, but only cards from the allowed country are accepted.

        The field expects a country code in ISO 3166-1 alpha-2 format, for example `NL`.
      example: NL
    issuer:
      type: *ref_114
      description: |-
        **Only relevant for iDEAL, KBC/CBC, gift card, and voucher payments.**

        **⚠️ With the introduction of iDEAL 2 in 2025, this field will be ignored for iDEAL payments. For more information
        on the migration, refer to our [help center](https://help.mollie.com/hc/articles/19100313768338-iDEAL-2-0).**

        Some payment methods are a network of connected banks or card issuers. In these cases, after selecting the payment
        method, the customer may still need to select the appropriate issuer before the payment can proceed.

        We provide hosted issuer selection screens, but these screens can be skipped by providing the `issuer` via the API
        up front.

        The full list of issuers for a specific method can be retrieved via the Methods API by using the optional
        `issuers` include.

        A valid issuer for iDEAL is for example `ideal_INGBNL2A` (for ING Bank).
