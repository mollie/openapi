            Most API credentials are specifically created for either live mode or test mode. In those cases the `testmode` query parameter can be omitted. For organization-level credentials such as OAuth access tokens, you can enable test mode by setting the `testmode` query parameter to `true`.

            Test entities cannot be retrieved when the endpoint is set to live mode, and vice versa.

        When processing payments with Mollie, we put all pending funds — usually minus Mollie fees — on a balance. Once you have linked a bank account to your Mollie account, we can pay out your balance towards this bank account.

        With the Balances API you can retrieve your current balance. The response includes two amounts:

        * The *pending amount*. These are payments that have been marked as `paid`, but are not yet available on your balance.
        * The *available amount*. This is the amount that you can get paid out to your bank account, or use for refunds.

        With instant payment methods like iDEAL, payments are moved to the available balance instantly. With slower payment methods, like credit card for example, it can take a few days before the funds are available on your balance. These funds will be shown under the *pending amount* in the meanwhile.

            Most API credentials are specifically created for either live mode or test mode. In those cases the `testmode` query parameter can be omitted. For organization-level credentials such as OAuth access tokens, you can enable test mode by setting the `testmode` query parameter to `true`.

            Test entities cannot be retrieved when the endpoint is set to live mode, and vice versa.

                      Totals are grouped according to the chosen grouping rule. The example response should give a good idea of what a typical grouping looks like.

                      If grouping `status-balances` is chosen, the main grouping is as follows:

                      * `pendingBalance` containing an `open`, `pending`, `movedToAvailable`, and `close` sub-group
                      * `availableBalance` containing an `open`, `movedFromPending`, `immediatelyAvailable`, and `close` sub-group

                      If grouping `transaction-categories` is chosen, the main grouping is as follows:

                      * `open` and `close` groups, each containing a `pending` and `available` sub-group
                      * Transaction type groups such as `payments` or `refunds`, each containing a `pending`, `movedToAvailable`, and `immediatelyAvailable` sub-group

                      Each sub-group typically has:

                      * An `amount` object containing the group's total amount
                      * A `count` integer if relevant (for example, counting the number of refunds)

        Retrieve a list of all balance transactions. Transactions include for example payments, refunds, chargebacks, and settlements.

        For an aggregated report of these balance transactions, refer to the [Get balance report](get-balance-report) endpoint.

        The alias `primary` can be used instead of the balance ID to refer to the organization's primary balance.

        The results are paginated.

        Retrieve a single settlement by its ID.

        To lookup settlements by their bank reference, replace the ID in the URL by a reference. For example: `1234567.2404.03`.

        A settlement represents a transfer of your balance funds to your external bank account.

        Settlements will typically include a report that details what balance transactions have taken place between this settlement and the previous one.

        For more accurate bookkeeping, refer to the [balance report](get-balance-report) endpoint or the [balance transactions](list-balance-transactions) endpoint.

                      For bookkeeping purposes, the settlement includes an overview of transactions included in the settlement. These transactions are grouped into 'period' objects — one for each calendar month.

                      For example, if a settlement includes funds from 15 April until 4 May, it will include two period objects. One for all transactions processed between 15 April and 30 April, and one for all transactions between 1 May and 4 May.

                      Period objects are grouped by year, and then by month. So in the above example, the full `periods` collection will look as follows: `{"2024": {"04": {...}, "05": {...}}}`.

                      Each period object will contain the following fields:
                      * `revenue` — An array of revenue objects containing the total revenue for each payment method during this period
                      * `costs` — An array of cost objects, describing the fees withheld for each payment method during this period
                      * `invoiceId` — The ID of the invoice created for this period, if the invoice has been created yet

                      Each `revenue` object has the following fields:
                      * `description` — A description of the revenue subtotal
                      * `method` — The payment method, if applicable
                      * `count` — The number of payments
                      * `amountNet` — The net total of received funds, i.e. excluding VAT
                      * `amountVat` — The applicable VAT
                      * `amountGross` — The gross total of received funds, i.e. including VAT

                      Each `cost` object has the following fields:
                      * `description` — A description of the cost subtotal
                      * `method` — The payment method, if applicable
                      * `count` — The number of fees
                      * `rate` — The service rates, further divided into `fixed` and `percentage` costs
                      * `amountNet` — The net total cost, i.e. excluding VAT
                      * `amountVat` — The applicable VAT
                      * `amountGross` — The gross total cost, i.e. including VAT

                      The example response should give a good idea of what this looks like in practise.

            Most API credentials are specifically created for either live mode or test mode. In those cases the `testmode` query parameter can be omitted. For organization-level credentials such as OAuth access tokens, you can enable test mode by setting the `testmode` query parameter to `true`.

            Test entities cannot be retrieved when the endpoint is set to live mode, and vice versa.

        Retrieve a single organization by its ID.

        You can normally only retrieve the currently authenticated organization with this endpoint. This is primarily useful for OAuth apps. See also [Get current organization](get-current-organization).

        If you have a *partner account*', you can retrieve organization details of connected organizations.

          description: |-
            Most API credentials are specifically created for either live mode or test mode. In those cases the `testmode` query parameter can be omitted. For organization-level credentials such as OAuth access tokens, you can enable test mode by setting the `testmode` query parameter to `true`.

            Test entities cannot be retrieved when the endpoint is set to live mode, and vice versa.

        Retrieve a list of capabilities for an organization.

        This API provides detailed insights into the specific requirements and status of each client's onboarding journey.

        Capabilities are at the organization level, indicating if the organization can perform a given capability.

        For payments, regardless them being at the profile level, the capability is listed at the organization level. This means that if at least one of the clients's profiles can receive payments, the payments capability is enabled, communicating that the organization can indeed receive payments.

        Link a new or existing organization to your OAuth application, in effect creating a new client. The response contains a `clientLink` where you should redirect your customer to.

        The `clientLink` URL behaves similar to the regular OAuth authorization URL. It supports the following parameters from the [Authorize](authorize) endpoint:

        * `client_id`
        * `state`
        * `approval_prompt`
        * `scope`

        We recommend at least requesting the scopes `onboarding.read onboarding.write` this way.

        Error handling is also dealt with similar to the [Authorize](authorize) endpoint: the customer is redirected back to your app's redirect URL with the `error` and `error_description` parameters added to the URL.

        **⚠️ We no longer recommend implementing the Orders API. Please refer to the Payments API instead. We are actively working on adding support for Klarna, Billie, in3 and Vouchers to the Payments API later this year.**

        When creating an order, a payment will automatically be created to allow your customer to pay for the order. You can then redirect your customer to the URL in the `_links.checkout` property from the response, similar to the Payments API.

        Unlike the Payments API, if a payment fails, expires, or is canceled, you can create a new payment under the same order using the [Create order payment endpoint](create-order-payment). This is only possible for orders that still have the `created` status.

                    The URL your customer will be redirected to after the payment process.

                    It could make sense for the redirectUrl to contain a unique identifier – like your order ID – so you can show the right page referencing the order when your customer returns.

                    The parameter is normally required, but can be omitted for recurring payments (`sequenceType: recurring`) and for Apple Pay payments with an `applePayPaymentToken`.

                    The URL your customer will be redirected to when the customer explicitly cancels the payment. If this URL is not provided, the customer will be redirected to the `redirectUrl` instead — see above.

                    Mollie will always give you status updates via webhooks, including for the canceled status. This parameter is therefore entirely optional, but can be useful when implementing a dedicated customer-facing flow to handle payment cancellations.

                    The webhook URL where we will send order status updates to.

                    The webhookUrl is optional, but without a webhook you will miss out on important status changes to your order.

                    The webhookUrl must be reachable from Mollie's point of view, so you cannot use `localhost`. If you want to use webhook during development on `localhost`, you must use a tool like ngrok to have the webhooks delivered to your local machine.

                    Allows you to preset the language to be used in the hosted payment pages shown to the customer. Setting a locale is highly recommended and will greatly improve your conversion rate. When this parameter is omitted the browser language will be used instead if supported by the payment method. You can provide any `xx_XX` format ISO 15897 locale, but our hosted payment pages currently only support the specified languages.

                    For bank transfer payments specifically, the locale will determine the target bank account the customer has to transfer the money to. We have dedicated bank accounts for Belgium, Germany, and The Netherlands. Having the customer use a local bank account greatly increases the conversion and speed of payment.

                    Normally, a payment method screen is shown. However, when using this parameter, you can choose a specific payment method and your customer will skip the selection screen and is sent directly to the chosen payment method. The parameter enables you to fully integrate the payment method selection into your website.

                    You can also specify the methods in an array. By doing so we will still show the payment method selection screen but will only show the methods specified in the array. For example, you can use this functionality to only show payment methods from a specific country to your customer `['bancontact', 'belfius']`.

                    Possible values: `applepay` `bancomatpay` `bancontact` `banktransfer` `belfius` `billie` `creditcard` `directdebit` `eps` `giftcard` `ideal` `in3` `kbc` `klarna` `klarnapaylater` `klarnapaynow` `klarnasliceit` `mybank` `paypal` `paysafecard` `przelewy24` `riverty` `satispay` `trustly` `twint` `voucher`

                    This field is similar to the `restrictPaymentMethodsToCountry` field in the Payments API.

            Most API credentials are specifically created for either live mode or test mode. In those cases the `testmode` query parameter can be omitted. For organization-level credentials such as OAuth access tokens, you can enable test mode by setting the `testmode` query parameter to `true`.

            Test entities cannot be retrieved when the endpoint is set to live mode, and vice versa.

            Most API credentials are specifically created for either live mode or test mode. In those cases the `testmode` query parameter can be omitted. For organization-level credentials such as OAuth access tokens, you can enable test mode by setting the `testmode` query parameter to `true`.

            Test entities cannot be retrieved when the endpoint is set to live mode, and vice versa.

                    Test entities cannot be retrieved when the endpoint is set to live mode, and vice versa.

        **⚠️ We no longer recommend implementing the Orders API. Please refer to the Payments API instead. We are actively working on adding support for Klarna, Billie, in3 and Vouchers to the Payments API later this year.**

        An open order may be canceled if it does not have any open payments yet, and while its status is either `created`, `authorized`, or `shipping`.

        If the order was already authorized, the authorization will be released.

        For an order with status `shipping`, only the order lines that were still pending will be canceled if possible. If a payment method was used that does not support authorizations, cancelation is no longer possible. You will have to issue a refund instead.

            Most API credentials are specifically created for either live mode or test mode. In those cases the `testmode` query parameter can be omitted. For organization-level credentials such as OAuth access tokens, you can enable test mode by setting the `testmode` query parameter to `true`.

            Test entities cannot be retrieved when the endpoint is set to live mode, and vice versa.

        **⚠️ We no longer recommend implementing the Orders API. Please refer to the Payments API instead. We are actively working on adding support for Klarna, Billie, in3 and Vouchers to the Payments API later this year.**

        Use this endpoint to update, cancel, or add one or more order lines of a `created`, `pending`, or `authorized` order.

        For an already authorized order, updating the order lines will trigger an additional authorization request to the payment method provider.

        For example, your customer placed an order that contains two order lines:

        * Order line A contains two items and amounts to €100.00.
        * Order line B contains a discount of 10% applicable to the items in order line A, which amounts to -€10.00.

        The order total is €90.00.

        You only have one item of type A left, and therefore contact your customer to find another solution. The customer opts to replace one of order line A's items with item C. Item C costs €40.00, however, discount B does not apply to item C.

        Using this endpoint, you can create a request to update the order lines, where:

        * Order line A is updated to quantity 1.
        * Order line B is updated to discount amount -€5.00.
        * Order line C is added with amount €40.00.

        The updated order totals €85.00.

        Cancel one or more order lines that were previously authorized. To cancel the entire order, please refer to the [Cancel order](cancel-order) endpoint instead.

        Canceling or partially canceling an order line will immediately release the authorization held for that amount. You should cancel an order line if you do not intend to (fully) ship it.

        If the order line was already authorized, the authorization will be released.

        For an order line with status `shipping`, the authorization for the quantity that is still pending will be released.

        Afterwards, the order line will be marked `completed`.

        If the order line is `paid` or already `completed`, you can create a refund using the [Create order refund](create-order-refund) endpoint instead.

                          The amount is required only if you are *partially* canceling an order line which has a non-zero `discountAmount`.

                          The amount you can cancel depends on various properties of the order line and the cancel order lines request. The maximum that can be canceled is `unit price x quantity to cancel`.

                          The minimum amount depends on the discount applied to the line, the quantity already shipped or canceled, the amounts already shipped or canceled and the quantity you want to cancel.

                          If you do not send an amount, Mollie will determine the amount automatically or respond with an error if the amount cannot be determined automatically.

        Update an order line belonging to an order. Only lines with status `created`, `pending`, or `authorized` can be updated.

        This endpoint is useful for cases where specific details of an order line are changed. For example, if a customer changes a red shirt for a blue one of the same model. In this case only specific properties of the order line need to be updated, such as the `name`, the `imageUrl`, and perhaps the `amount`.

        To swap out an order line for an entirely new order line, use the [Manage order lines](manage-order-lines) endpoint instead.

        For an in-depth explanation of each parameter, refer to the `lines` parameter of the [Create order](create-order) endpoint.

        **⚠️ We no longer recommend implementing the Orders API. Please refer to the Payments API instead. We are actively working on adding support for Klarna, Billie, in3 and Vouchers to the Payments API later this year.**

        An order has an automatically created payment that your customer can use to pay for the order. When the payment expires you can create a new payment for the order using this endpoint. A maximum of 25 payments can be created for an order.

        A new payment can only be created while the status of the order is `created`, and when the status of the existing payment is either `expired`, `canceled` or `failed`.

        The endpoint accepts virtually all parameters accepted by the regular [Create payment](create-payment) endpoint. Please refer to that endpoint for the full documentation of all parameters.

        The payment inherits certain properties, such as the `amount` and `webhookUrl`, directly from the order. These cannot be changed via this endpoint.

        Payment creation is elemental to the Mollie API: this is where most payment implementations start off.

        Once you have created a payment, you should redirect your customer to the URL in the `_links.checkout` property from the response.

        To wrap your head around the payment process, an explanation and flow charts can be found in the 'Accepting payments' guide.

        If you specify the `method` parameter when creating a payment, optional additional parameters may be available for the payment method that are not listed below. Please refer to the guide on [method-specific parameters](extra-payment-parameters).

                    The description of the payment. This will be shown to your customer on their card or bank statement when possible. We truncate the description automatically according to the limits of the used payment method. The description is also visible in any exports you generate.

                    We recommend you use a unique identifier so that you can always link the payment to the order in your back office. This is particularly useful for bookkeeping.

                    The maximum length of the description field differs per payment method, with the absolute maximum being 255 characters. The API will not reject strings longer than the maximum length but it will truncate them to fit.
                  maxLength: 255

                    You can find the minimum and maximum amounts per payment method in our help center. Additionally, they can be retrieved using the Get method endpoint.

                    If a tip was added for a Point-of-Sale payment, the amount will be updated to reflect the initial amount plus the tip amount.

                    This optional field will contain the approximate amount that will be settled to your account, converted to the currency your account is settled in.

                    Any amounts not settled by Mollie will not be reflected in this amount, e.g. PayPal or gift cards. If no amount is settled by Mollie the `settlementAmount` is omitted from the response.

                    Please note that this amount might be recalculated and changed when the status of the payment changes. We suggest using the List balance transactions endpoint instead to get more accurate settlement amounts for your payments.

                  type: *ref_21

                  description: |-
                    The URL your customer will be redirected to after the payment process.

                    It could make sense for the redirectUrl to contain a unique identifier – like your order ID – so you can show the right page referencing the order when your customer returns.

                    The parameter is normally required, but can be omitted for recurring payments (`sequenceType: recurring`) and for Apple Pay payments with an `applePayPaymentToken`.
                  example: https://example.org/redirect
                cancelUrl:
                  type:
                    - string
                    - 'null'
                  description: |-
                    The URL your customer will be redirected to when the customer explicitly cancels the payment. If this URL is not provided, the customer will be redirected to the `redirectUrl` instead — see above.

                    Mollie will always give you status updates via webhooks, including for the canceled status. This parameter is therefore entirely optional, but can be useful when implementing a dedicated customer-facing flow to handle payment cancellations.
                  example: https://example.org/cancel
                webhookUrl:
                  type:
                    - string
                    - 'null'
                  description: |-
                    The webhook URL where we will send payment status updates to.

                    The webhookUrl is optional, but without a webhook you will miss out on important status changes to your payment.

                    The webhookUrl must be reachable from Mollie's point of view, so you cannot use `localhost`. If you want to use webhook during development on `localhost`, you must use a tool like ngrok to have the webhooks delivered to your local machine.
                  example: https://example.org/webhooks
                lines:
                  type:

The parameter enables you to fully integrate the payment method selection into your website.

                    Some payment methods are a network of connected banks or card issuers. In these cases, after selecting the payment method, the customer may still need to select the appropriate issuer before the payment can proceed.

                    With Mollie Connect you can charge fees on payments that your app is processing on behalf of other Mollie merchants.

                    If you create payments on your own account that you want to split between yourself and one or more connected merchants, you can use this `routing` parameter to route the payment accordingly.

                    The `routing` parameter should contain an array of objects, with each object describing the destination for a specific portion of the payment.

                    It is not necessary to indicate in the array which portion goes to yourself. After all portions of the total payment amount have been routed, the amount left will be routed to the current organization automatically.

                    If instead you use OAuth to create payments on a connected merchant's account, refer to the `applicationFee` parameter.

                    Indicate which part of a recurring sequence this payment is for.

                    Recurring payments can only take place if a mandate is available. A common way to establish such a mandate is through a `first` payment. With a `first` payment, the customer agrees to automatic recurring charges taking place on their account in the future.

                    If set to `recurring`, the customer's card is charged automatically.

                    Defaults to `oneoff`, which is a regular non-recurring payment.

                    For PayPal payments, recurring is only possible if your connected PayPal account allows it. You can call our [Methods API](list-methods) with parameter `sequenceType: first` to discover which payment methods on your account are set up correctly for recurring payments.

                    Possible values: `oneoff` `first` `recurring` (default: `oneoff`)

                    When creating recurring payments, the ID of a specific [mandate](get-mandate) can be supplied to indicate which of the customer's accounts should be credited.

                    The ID of the [customer](get-customer) the payment is being created for. This is used primarily for recurring payments, but can also be used on regular payments to enable single-click payments.

                    The description of the payment. This will be shown to your customer on their card or bank statement when possible. We truncate the description automatically according to the limits of the used payment method. The description is also visible in any exports you generate.

                    We recommend you use a unique identifier so that you can always link the payment to the order in your back office. This is particularly useful for bookkeeping.

                    The maximum length of the description field differs per payment method, with the absolute maximum being 255 characters. The API will not reject strings longer than the maximum length but it will truncate them to fit.
                  maxLength: 255

                    Most API credentials are specifically created for either live mode or test mode. For organization-level credentials such as OAuth access tokens, you can enable test mode by setting `testmode` to `true`.

                    Test entities cannot be retrieved when the endpoint is set to live mode, and vice versa.

        Depending on the payment method, you may be able to cancel a payment for a certain amount of time — usually until the next business day or as long as the payment status is open.

        Payments may also be canceled manually from the Mollie Dashboard.

        The `isCancelable` property on the [Payment object](get-payment) will indicate if the payment can be canceled.

        Retrieve all enabled payment methods. The results of this endpoint are **not** paginated — unlike most other list endpoints in our API.

        For test mode, all pending and enabled payment methods are returned. If no payment methods are requested yet, the most popular payment methods are returned in the test mode. For live mode, only fully enabled payment methods are returned.

        Payment methods can be requested and enabled via the Mollie Dashboard, or via the [Enable payment method endpoint](enable-method) of the Profiles API.

        The list can optionally be filtered using a number of parameters described below.

        By default, only payment methods for the Euro currency are returned. If you wish to retrieve payment methods which exclusively support other currencies (e.g. Twint), you need to use the `amount` parameters.

        Retrieve a single payment method by its ID.

        If a method is not available on this profile, a `404 Not Found` response is returned. If the method is available but not enabled yet, a status `403 Forbidden` is returned. You can enable payments methods via the [Enable payment method endpoint](enable-method) of the Profiles API, or via the Mollie Dashboard.

        If you do not know the method's ID, you can use the [methods list endpoint](list-methods) to retrieve all payment methods that are available.

        Additionally, it is possible to check if wallet methods such as Apple Pay are enabled by passing the wallet ID (`applepay`) as the method ID.

            Most API credentials are specifically created for either live mode or test mode. In those cases the `testmode` query parameter can be omitted. For organization-level credentials such as OAuth access tokens, you can enable test mode by setting the `testmode` query parameter to `true`.

            Test entities cannot be retrieved when the endpoint is set to live mode, and vice versa.

        Enable a payment method on a specific profile.

        When using a profile-specific API credential, the alias `me` can be used instead of the profile ID to refer to the current profile.

        Some payment methods require extra steps in order to be activated. In cases where a step at the payment method provider needs to be completed first, the status will be set to `pending-external` and the response will contain a link to complete the activation at the provider.

        To enable voucher or gift card issuers, refer to the [Enable payment method issuer](enable-method-issuer) endpoint.

                    When enabling a voucher issuer, an inbetween party may be involved which you have a contract with. Provide the contract ID for the first time you enable an issuer via this contractor.

                    You can update the contract ID as long as it is not approved yet, by repeating the API call with a different contract ID.

                    The amount is a **negative** amount.

                    If the refund is not directly processed by Mollie, for example for PayPal refunds, the settlement amount will be zero.

                    Since the field contains an estimated amount during refund processing, it may change over time. For example, while the refund is queued the settlement amount is likely not yet available.

                    To retrieve accurate settlement amounts we recommend using the [List balance transactions endpoint](list-balance-transactions) instead.

                    With Mollie Connect you can charge fees on payments that your app is processing on behalf of other Mollie merchants, by providing the `routing` object during [payment creation](create-payment).

                    When creating refunds for these *routed* payments, by default the full amount is deducted from your balance.

                    If you want to pull back the funds that were routed to the connected merchant(s), you can set this parameter to `true` when issuing a full refund.

                    For more fine-grained control and for partial refunds, use the `routingReversals` parameter instead.

                    When creating refunds for *routed* payments, by default the full amount is deducted from your balance.

                    If you want to pull back funds from the connected merchant(s), you can use this parameter to specify what amount needs to be reversed from which merchant(s).

                    If you simply want to fully reverse the routed funds, you can also use the `reverseRouting` parameter instead.

            Most API credentials are specifically created for either live mode or test mode. In those cases the `testmode` query parameter can be omitted. For organization-level credentials such as OAuth access tokens, you can enable test mode by setting the `testmode` query parameter to `true`.

            Test entities cannot be retrieved when the endpoint is set to live mode, and vice versa.

        When using the Orders API, refunds should be made for a specific order.

        If you want to refund arbitrary amounts, however, you can also use the [Create payment refund endpoint](create-refund) by creating a refund on the payment itself.

        If an order line is still in the `authorized` state, it cannot be refunded. You should cancel it instead. Order lines that are `paid`, `shipping` or `completed` can be refunded.

                    If the refund is not directly processed by Mollie, for example for PayPal refunds, the settlement amount will be zero.

                    Since the field contains an estimated amount during refund processing, it may change over time. For example, while the refund is queued the settlement amount is likely not yet available.

                    To retrieve accurate settlement amounts we recommend using the [List balance transactions endpoint](list-balance-transactions) instead.

                          The amount that you want to refund. In almost all cases, Mollie can determine the amount automatically.

                          The amount is required only if you are partially refunding an order line which has a non-zero `discountAmount`.

                          The amount you can refund depends on various properties of the order line and the create order refund request. The maximum that can be refunded is `unit price x quantity to ship`.

                          The minimum amount depends on the discount applied to the line, the quantity already refunded or shipped, the amounts already refunded or shipped and the quantity you want to refund.

                          If you do not send an amount, Mollie will determine the amount automatically or respond with an error if the amount cannot be determined automatically. The error will contain the `extra.minimumAmount` and `extra.maximumAmount` properties that allow you pick the right amount.

        **This feature is currently in open beta. The final specification may still change.**

        Capture an *authorized* payment.

        Some payment methods allow you to first collect a customer's authorization, and capture the amount at a later point.

        By default, Mollie captures payments automatically. If however you configured your payment with `captureMode: manual`, you can capture the payment using this endpoint after having collected the customer's authorization.

        When integrating Apple Pay in your own checkout on the web, you need to [provide merchant validation](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/apple_pay_on_the_web/apple_pay_js_api/providing_merchant_validation). This is normally done using Apple's [Requesting an Apple Pay Session](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/apple_pay_on_the_web/apple_pay_js_api/requesting_an_apple_pay_payment_session). The merchant validation proves to Apple that a validated merchant is calling the Apple Pay Javascript APIs.

        To integrate Apple Pay via Mollie, you will have to call the Mollie API instead of Apple's API. The response of this API call can then be passed as-is to the completion method, `completeMerchantValidation`.

        Before requesting an Apple Pay Payment Session, you must place the domain validation file on your server at: `https://[domain]/.well-known/apple-developer-merchantid-domain-association`. Without this file, it will not be possible to use Apple Pay on your domain.

        Each new transaction requires a new payment session object. Merchant session objects are not reusable, and they expire after five minutes.

        Payment sessions cannot be requested directly from the browser. The request must be sent from your server. For the full documentation, see the official [Apple Pay JS API](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/apple_pay_on_the_web/apple_pay_js_api) documentation.

                    A list of all [valid host names](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/apple_pay_on_the_web/setting_up_your_server) for merchant validation is available. You should white list these in your application and reject any `validationUrl`s that have a host name not in the list.

                    The identifier referring to the [profile](get-profile) this entity belongs to.

                    Most API credentials are linked to a single profile. In these cases the `profileId` can be omitted in the creation request. For organization-level credentials such as OAuth access tokens however, the `profileId` parameter is required.

        With the Payment links API you can generate payment links that by default, unlike regular payments, do not expire. The payment link can be shared with your customers and will redirect them to them the payment page where they can complete the payment. A [payment](get-payment) will only be created once the customer initiates the payment.

                    The webhookUrl is optional, but without a webhook you will miss out on important status changes to any payments resulting from the payment link.

                    The webhookUrl must be reachable from Mollie's point of view, so you cannot use `localhost`. If you want to use webhook during development on `localhost`, you must use a tool like ngrok to have the webhooks delivered to your local machine.

                    Most API credentials are linked to a single profile. In these cases the `profileId` can be omitted in the creation request. For organization-level credentials such as OAuth access tokens however, the `profileId` parameter is required.

                    With Mollie Connect you can charge fees on payment links that your app is processing on behalf of other Mollie merchants.

                    If you use OAuth to create payment links on a connected merchant's account, you can charge a fee using this `applicationFee` parameter. If a payment on the payment link succeeds, the fee will be deducted from the merchant's balance and sent to your own account balance.

            Most API credentials are specifically created for either live mode or test mode. In those cases the `testmode` query parameter can be omitted. For organization-level credentials such as OAuth access tokens, you can enable test mode by setting the `testmode` query parameter to `true`.

            Test entities cannot be retrieved when the endpoint is set to live mode, and vice versa.

                    With Mollie Connect you can charge fees on payment links that your app is processing on behalf of other Mollie merchants.

                    If you use OAuth to create payment links on a connected merchant's account, you can charge a fee using this `applicationFee` parameter. If a payment on the payment link succeeds, the fee will be deducted from the merchant's balance and sent to your own account balance.

                        Be careful to leave enough space for Mollie's own fees to be deducted as well. For example, you cannot charge a €0.99 fee on a €1.00 payment.

        Payment links which have not been opened and no payments have been made yet can be deleted entirely. This can be useful for removing payment links that have been incorrectly configured or that are no longer relevant.

        Once deleted, the payment link will no longer show up in the API or Mollie dashboard.

        To simply disable a payment link without fully deleting it, you can use the `archived` parameter on the [Update payment link](update-payment-link) endpoint instead.

        Creates a payment for the customer.

        Linking customers to payments enables you to:

        * Keep track of payment preferences for your customers
        * Allow your customers to charge a previously used credit card with a single click in our hosted checkout
        * Improve payment insights in the Mollie dashboard
        * Use recurring payments

        This endpoint is effectively an alias of the [Create payment endpoint](create-payment) with the `customerId` parameter predefined. Please refer to the documentation of that endpoint for all possible parameters.

        Create a mandate for a specific customer. Mandates allow you to charge a customer's card, PayPal account or bank account recurrently.

        It is only possible to create mandates for IBANs and PayPal billing agreements with this endpoint. To create mandates for cards, your customers need to perform a 'first payment' with their card.

        With subscriptions, you can schedule recurring payments to take place at regular intervals.

        For example, by simply specifying an `amount` and an `interval`, you can create an endless subscription to charge a monthly fee, until you cancel the subscription.

        Or, you could use the times parameter to only charge a limited number of times, for example to split a big transaction in multiple parts.

        A few example usages:

        `amount[currency]="EUR"` `amount[value]="5.00"` `interval="2 weeks"` Your customer will be charged €5 once every two weeks.

        `amount[currency]="EUR"` `amount[value]="20.00"` `interval="1 day" times=5` Your customer will be charged €20 every day, for five consecutive days.

        `amount[currency]="EUR"` `amount[value]="10.00"` `interval="1 month"` `startDate="2018-04-30"` Your customer will be charged €10 on the last day of each month, starting in April 2018.
